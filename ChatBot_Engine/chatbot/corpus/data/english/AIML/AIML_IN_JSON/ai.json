Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns. AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors. Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience. An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the <aiml> and </aiml> tags respectively."

			"WHAT IS THE IMITATION GAME",
			"The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading 'chat-handles' like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either 'lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman' or 'shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man.' In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, ''What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, 'Can machines think?''"

			"WHAT IS XML",
			" David Bacon pronounces it 'Eggsmell'. XML is the Extensible Markup Language. Like many 'standards' in computer science, XML is a moving target. In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized version of HTML. Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context. AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized language for artificial intelligence. One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools to edit and manipulate XML format files. Another reason is that an XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already familiar with HTML. Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable convenience for programming web chat robots. A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org. "
